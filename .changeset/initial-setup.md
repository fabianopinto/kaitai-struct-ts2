# v0.1.0 - Phase 1 Foundation Release

Initial release of kaitai-struct-ts - a TypeScript runtime interpreter for Kaitai Struct binary format definitions.

## üéâ Phase 1 MVP Complete

This release establishes the foundation for the project with a complete binary stream reader implementation and comprehensive project infrastructure.

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Implementation

- **KaitaiStream** - Complete binary stream reader
  - Unsigned integers: u1, u2le, u2be, u4le, u4be, u8le, u8be
  - Signed integers: s1, s2le, s2be, s4le, s4be, s8le, s8be
  - Floating point: f4le, f4be, f8le, f8be (IEEE 754)
  - Byte arrays: fixed length, until terminator, all remaining
  - Strings: UTF-8, ASCII, Latin-1, UTF-16LE, UTF-16BE
  - Bit-level reading: readBitsIntBe, readBitsIntLe
  - Position management: seek, pos, isEof
  - Substreams: isolated stream views

### Error Handling

- `KaitaiError` - Base error class with position tracking
- `EOFError` - End of stream errors
- `ParseError` - Parsing failures
- `ValidationError` - Validation failures
- `NotImplementedError` - Feature placeholders
